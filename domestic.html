        <p><h2>Advantages of Waste Management</h2>
            There are various advantages of waste management. Some of them are below:
            
            Decrease bad odor– Waste produces a lot of bad odor which is harmful to the environment. Moreover, Bad odor is responsible for various diseases in children. As a result, it hampers their growth. So waste management eliminates all these problems in an efficient way.

Furthermore, it increases the hygiene of the city so that people may get a better environment to live in.
            
            Reduces the production of waste -Recycling of the products helps in reducing waste. Furthermore, it generates new products which are again useful. Moreover, recycling reduces the use of new products. So the companies will decrease their production rate.It generates employment– The waste management system needs workers. These workers can do various jobs from collecting to the disposing of waste. Therefore it creates opportunities for the people that do not have any job. Furthermore, this will help them in contributing to society.

            Produces Energy– Many waste products can be further used to produce energy. For instance, some products can generate heat by burning. Furthermore, some organic products are useful in fertilizers. Therefore it can increase the fertility of the soil.

            <p><h2>Awareness Campaign on Waste Management and Disposal</h2>
                Why Awareness campaign on waste management is so important?
                
                Waste management and disposal of waste is a serious issue that we are facing nowadays. If we are not aware of proper waste management, it leads to serious issues like air pollution, water pollution, and soil pollution. By doing small practices in our daily life we can make a huge difference. For that, we all have to practice the “3Rs” in our daily life.
                
                The 3Rs – Reuse, Reduce, Recycle
                Reduce- try to reduce the use of single-use products maximum especially plastic substances.
                
                Reuse- always try to reuse day to life things. For example, carry kit when you are going for shopping.
                Recycle- try maximum to recycle or reuse things other than disposing of.

Above all 3R’s will help us and our society for the proper disposal of waste management.<br>

In a bid to raise awareness regarding effective disposal of waste, students of the Department of Communicative English visited a total of 329 houses in Mulavukad Grama Panchayat. They shared knowledge and strategies on proper waste management. With the help of Google Forms, the present methods of waste disposal were studied and the concept of bucket composting was introduced. A report based on the survey was later submitted to the Panchayat President.

                <p><h2>Waste Management System in India</h2>
                    Waste management market comprises of four segments - Municipal
                    Waste, Industrial Waste, Bio- Medical Waste and Electronic Waste Market.
                    All these four types of waste are governed by different laws and policies as is
                    the nature of the waste. In India waste management practice depend upon
                    actual waste generation, primary storage, primary collection, secondary
                    collection and transportation, recycling activity, Treatment and disposal. In
                    India, municipality corporations play very important role in waste
                    management in each city along with public health department. Municipal
                    Corporation is responsible for the management of the MSW generated in the
                    city, among its other duties. The public health department is responsible for
                    sanitation, street cleansing, epidemic control and food adulteration. There is
                    a clear and strong hierarchy of posts in the Municipal Corporation. The
                    highest authority of Municipal Corporation rests with the Mayor, who is
                    elected to the post for tenure of five years. Under the Mayor, there is a City
                    Commissioner. Under the city commissioner, there is Executive Officer who
                    supervises various departments such as public health, water works, public
                    works, house tax, lights, projection tax, demand and a workshop, which, in turn, all are headed by their own department heads. The staffs in the Public
                    health department are as follows: Health officer, Chief sanitary and food
                    inspector, Sanitary and food inspectors, Sanitary supervisor, Sweepers, etc.
                    The entire operation of solid waste management (SWM) system is performed
                    under four headings, namely, street cleansing, collection, transportation and
                    disposal. The cleansing and collection operations are conducted by the public
                    health department of city Municipality Corporation, while transportation and
                    disposal of waste are carried out by the transportation department of city
                    Municipality Corporation. The entire city can be divided in to different
                    zones. These zones are further divided into different sanitary wards for the
                    purpose of solid waste collection and transport operations. Currently waste
                    management in India mostly means a picking up waste from residential and
                    industrial areas and dumping it at landfill sites. The authorities, usually
                    municipal, are obligated to handle solid waste generated within their
                    respective boundaries; the usual practice followed is of lifting solid waste
                    from the point of generation and hauling to distant places known as dumping
                    grounds and/or landfill sites for discarding. The treatment given to waste
                    once thus emptied is restricted to spreading the heap over larger space so as
                    to take away the waste from the public gaze. Waste collection is usually doneon a contract basis. In most cities it is done by rag pickers, small- time
                    contractors and municipalities.</p>

                        <p><h3>Initiatives taken by Indian corporate</h3>
                            In India, there are various initiatives taken by many corporations.
                            For example HCL Info system believes that the producers of electronic
                            goods are responsible for facilitating an environmental friendly disposal,once the product has reached the end of its life. HCL Info system supports
                            the ongoing initiative for separate e-waste legislation in India. HCL has been
                            working on an easy, convenient and safe programme for recycling of e-waste
                            in India. HCL has created the online process of e-waste recycling request
                            registration, where customers (both individual and corporate) can register
                            their requests for disposal of their e-waste. Apart from corporate customers,
                            HCL has extended its e-waste collection program to retail customers also
                            through its HCL Touch spread points spread across the country HCL extends
                            the recycling facility to its users regardless of the fact, when and where they
                            purchased the product. To promote recycling of electronic waste, Nokia
                            India launched a 'Take Back' campaign where customers can drop their old
                            handset in the company’s stores and win gifts. The take-back campaign is
                            aimed at educating mobile phone users on the importance of recycling ewaste. As a part of this initiative, Nokia encourage mobile phone users to
                            dispose their used handsets and accessories such as charges and handsets,
                            regardless of the brand, at any of the recycling bins set up across Nokia
                            Priority Dealers and Nokia Care Centers. ITC Ltd has chosen energy
                            management, environmental & waste management and social & farm
                            forestry as major focus areas for CSR. Specific processes include
                            recycling/reuse of paper mill back water for dilution of bleached pulp,
                            recycling of paper machine primary clarifier outlet water for miscellaneous
                            uses, etc. These are few examples to show that Indian corporate is not behind
                            in producing initiatives related to waste management.
